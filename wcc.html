      <h1>Webmasta's Coding Challenge</h1>
      <h5>Dear Mafiosi,</h5>
      <p>I have decided to resign from the position of Webmaster for the Mafia Club. This was not an easy choice, but due to unforeseen issues, I cannot remain in the role. I still aim to attend meetings as a member.</p>
      <p>The club constitution states that other officers, upon resignation, have a successor chosen by special election. However, the Webmaster is built different and hence succeeded by "any member as elected by art contest, dance battle, trial by combat, zombie summoning, a friendly conversation, or any method chosen by [the Webmaster]."</p>
      <p>Thus, I thought it fitting to choose a successor through a coding challenge that tests both your knowledge of the website and your knowledge of skills commonly used in web development. Even more fitting would be making that coding challenge mirror the way in which I became Webmasta myself.</p>
      <p>I became Webmasta when I used the browser developer tools to make the list of then-hidden roles (what is now Standard+) visible, and the old webmaster thought I had hacked the site until I revealed what I did. I was given the position right then and there. You will do a similar thing. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to make a local copy of the <a href="/">homepage</a> with the following changes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Remove the Illuminati role from all sets in which it appears.</li>
        <li>Put your name in Common Terms as a new 3rd-party role with whatever you want as a description.</li>
        <li>Add a new 4th-party "Webmaster" role that appears only in Standard and Standard+. Its description is your pitch for why you should be the next Webmaster (does not have to be serious).</li>
        <li>Create an entirely new role whose name, side, and ability are whatever you want, and put it in whatever set(s) you see fit. Bonus points if your role is balanced/interesting.</li>
        <li>No changes other than the above should be made. For instance, you cannot replace an existing Common Term with your nameâ€”that would count as removing something. You must add a new one.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Your local copy need not be accessible to others. As long as one device of your choosing can display these changes, you are good to go. Of course, if you do become Webmaster, you probably shouldn't publish these changes. It is technically possible to just save and edit a copy of the homepage, but there are better ways. Use of the browser developer tools is not only allowed but strongly encouraged. You are applying for the club's web dev position, after all!</p>
      <p>Your changes must <em>persist past page loads</em>. The developer tools may be open while the page loads, but reloading the page must not revert it to normal. Inspect Element alone will not suffice.</p>
      <p>If you have questions, feel free to ask me. The first member to complete the challenge and demonstrate their working solution in person at a meeting will receive the Webmaster position (ties broken by vote). Since you are going to be an officer, commitment is a must. You must have attended at least 25% of meetings last semester. Being a CS major is not required. I myself am not one!</p>
      <p>Thank you everyone for making Mafia Club fun. It was an honor serving as Webmasta for two years. Good luck!</p>
      <h5 style="text-align:right">Sincerely,<br>Webmasta</h5>
      <p>P.S: Please avoid generative AI for anything other than high-level questions. I did not need it; neither should you. The idea is for you to gain common web development skills, not for you to ask ChatGPT how to edit a website. Though I cannot enforce this, know that honesty is important, even in a club about lying to your friends. Thanks!</p>
