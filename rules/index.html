    <h1>Rules</h1>
    <p>The game begins with the night phase.</p>
    <h3>Night</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Living players go to sleep (close their eyes or look away from the others). Dead players have no actions and do not sleep. Discussing the game is not allowed at night.</li>
      <li>The moderator (mod) wakes up the Mafia, who may or may not be shown each others' roles. Together, they pick someone to kill and also which Mafia kills them.</li>
      <li>Other players are woken up to perform their	night actions based on their roles.</li>
      <li>The mod will check that everyone who was meant to take an action did so.</li>
  	</ol>
      <h3>Day</h3>
      <p>Players wake up. The mod makes all announcements from the night before, mostly deaths but sometimes players getting milk, being silenced, etc. The day works thusly:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Players discuss the night, and form a block (list of candidates who may be voted out). To be put on the block, a player must be nominated by one person and seconded by another.</li>
      <li>When 2 players are on the block (3 if more than 7 players are alive), the block is "locked" and cannot be changed. Everyone on the block gives a defense (statement of why they should not be voted out). Others cannot talk without the defender's consent.</li>
      <li>The town decides whom to vote out.</li>
      <li>The town votes among the players on the block. Whoever gets the most votes dies. In case of a tie, the vote is repeated. If it ties thrice, no one dies.</li>
      <li>Regardless of whether or not someone was voted out, night begins. Repeat until the game ends.</li>
    </ol>
      <p>In addition, during the day, players may motion to "no vote" or "reblock" at any point during the day before voting starts. If another player seconds this motion, the town votes on the motion. If it has majority support, the motion passes. A no-vote begins night without voting anyone out, and a reblock clears the block and restarts nominations. Each of these can be used only once per game.</p>
    <h3>Game End</h3>
      <p>The Town wins by killing all non-Town players. The Mafia win if all third parties die and the number of Mafia equals the number of Town. Third parties win as the last one alive unless their role says otherwise.</p>
  	<h3>Additional Notes</h3>
  	<ol>
      <li>The mod will announce the time remaining during the day. The town may motion for more time, or motion to skip to voting. There is no limit to how many times these can be used. If these motions are seconded the mod may call for a vote, or directly deny/accept the motion.</li>
      <li><em>If you have a question at any time during the game, feel free to ask the mod. They are there to help.</em></li>
      <li>Some nights may take a long time. The mod may be working out complex role interactions, or players may take a while to decide their night action. Be patient.</li>
      <li>Mods often use "first night immunity". This means that a person (usually the one who died first in the previous game, or first-time players) cannot be killed the first night. This is meant to keep people from dying immediately several games in a row.</li>
