    <h1 id="rules">Playing on Zoom</h1>
    <p>Mafia is great in person, but if you cannot meet personally, you can still play on Zoom with these rules. You may want to see the <a href="/rules/">normal rules</a>.</p>
    <h3>Setup</h3>
    <ol>
  		<li>Be sure the mod is the meeting host (not co-host). If not, the current host must make the mod host.</li>
        <li>To assign roles, the mod sends each player their role in private chat.</li>
  		<li>Set breakout room settings to: participants cannot choose their rooms, are not allowed to return to the main meeting, are automatically moved to breakout rooms, and are not automatically moved to the main meeting; and the rooms do not auto close or have a close countdown.</li>
        <li>Make 1 breakout room per player (not the mod).</li>
        <li>Auto-assigning people to rooms should put 1 person in each room. If not, move people to have 1 per room.</li>
  	</ol>
    <h3>Night</h3>
    <ol>
  		<li>Open the rooms.</li>
  		<li>When everyone is in a room, the mod "wakes up" players by joining their room. Players will communicate their night action to the mod.</li>
        <li>Players "sleep" when the mod leaves their room.</li>
  		<li>If players must wake together (mafia/masons), the mod moves them into the same room before joining it. Joining that room is equivalent to waking them all. When the players sleep, the mod must SEPARATE the players before leaving the room. Separating players is crucial because it prevents players from having extra talking time during others' night actions (when they'd be asleep in an normal game). It also  keeps Masons from figuring out who is Illuminati based on who gets moved out of the room to act with the Mafia.</li>
  	</ol>
    <h3>Day</h3>
    <ol>
  		<li>Close the rooms. Wait for everyone to come to the main meeting.</li>
  		<li>The day proceeds the same as normal. Go back to Night when the day ends.</li>
        <li>Sometimes the mod may want to disallow private conversations in a game. To do this, pick "Participants can chat with everyone", which disables private chat. If not, pick "Participants can chat with everyone and anyone directly".</li>
        <li>Dead people are free to turn off their video/audio. Living players should keep them on if possible.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The day-night cycle continues until the game ends.</p>
    <h3>Optional</h3>
  	<ul>
  		<li>Reduce hassle by making players use the Raise Hand feature before nominating (participants appear in the order they raised their hand), or type nominations in the chat. This allows the order of nominations to be clear instead of people arguing over who spoke first. This should be established before the game.</li>
  		<li>The mod may force mute people to stop them from talking if dead, silenced, or in others' defenses. Note that people thus muted cannot unmute unless the host invites them to.</li>
  		<li>Silenced and dead players must not use the chat. In defenses, everyone is silenced except the defender. If people continue to chat when they shouldn't, the mod may disable the chat ("Participants can chat with no one"). In that case, allow chat to everyone when defenses end. In egregious cases, an offender can be moved to the waiting room.</li>
        <li>Rename players to show their "status" (dead, silenced, on the block, etc.) If you do this, you may want to not allow people to rename themselves. Don't do this for a status that is not known to everyone (e.g. only the person framed knows they are framed, and people don't know they're doused).</li>
        <li>Spotlight players in their defense.</li>
        <li>Dead players do not have to sleep. Moving them out of breakout rooms into the main meeting lets them talk to each other.</li>
        <li>To let dead players more actively spectate, allow people to choose their own breakout room, so dead people can watch live players do actions. If you do this, make sure live players don't move rooms and make sure the dead don't communicate with the living.</li>
    </ul>
